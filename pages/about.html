        <section class="about-text">
          Rusty Brown’s started out small—really small. Not big, not huge, just a modest beginning tucked away in the back of a dry cleaner’s shop. The kitchen wasn’t spotless, but it was a space where donuts could be made, where ideas could take shape.
<br/>Over time, things changed—not all at once, but steadily. One shop became two, then more followed, and before long, our little operation had grown. We built a system—not flawless, but functional—allowing more people in more places to enjoy what we created.
<br/>From the start, our goal was simple: to bring joy. A good donut does more than just satisfy hunger—it makes people smile. Fried, sweet, hot - our donuts weren’t just food, they were a moment, a feeling, a memory.
<br/>Rusty Brown’s donuts have their own kind of magic—the perfect balance of crunch on the outside and pillowy softness inside. Some love them, others appreciate them in their own way, but one thing’s for sure: they leave an impression.
